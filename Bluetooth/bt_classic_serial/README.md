## Bluetooth Classic  - SPP (Serial Port Profile) Example

This example demonstrates how to use Bluetooth Classic SPP to control an LED by sending commands from a Bluetooth client(e.g., a smartphone app).
The LED can be turned on or off by sending "led on" or "led off" commands from the client.
The button state is also monitored, and its state changes are sent to the client.
